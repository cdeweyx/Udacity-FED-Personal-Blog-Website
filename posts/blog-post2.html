                <p class="post-content">Arguably the poster child for cognitive biases, confirmation bias is the idea that we favor things that confirm our existing beliefs. This is for good reason. Confirmation bias is everywhere. We want to be right. Hell, it’s uncomfortable being wrong. Can you really blame our minds for trying to trick us from time to time?</p>
                <p class="post-content">This is especially dangerous for data scientists. Consider the last time you performed some sort of analysis. If the project was of any interest to you, then you probably went into it with some hypothesis, idea, or favorable outcome that you thought would happen. This is where bias comes into play.</p>
                <p class="post-content">You are more likely to interpret your findings as supporting evidence for your prior beliefs. We can’t completely avoid this, but if you are aware of it then you can realize when confirmation bias is likely, and calibrate your thoughts accordingly. We love a good story. At least Tyrion thought so. Data science and analysis is no different. Narrative fallacy is the idea that we want to connect the dots to weave a story, even when there isn’t one to tell. We desperately want reality to fit our model of the world, but it often doesn’t.</p>
                <p class="post-content">Let’s think about an example. You’re a data scientist for a consumer internet company and the number of daily active users grew, but the average time spent on the product went down. How would you interpret this?</p>
