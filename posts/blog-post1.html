                <p class="date">June 2019</p>
                <p class="post-content">Chances are that you’ve come across someone on social media talking about their latest crack at an ambitious challenge, goal, or experiment. It’s pretty common, at least in my little bubble. I think we can all agree that, to an extent, this is a good thing. It’s become standard practice to set goals, track your progress, and hit milestones that bring you a step closer to the person that you want to be.</p>
                <p class="post-content">To be honest, I’m all for this sort of stuff. In my experience, I’ve had the most success when learning new things by setting measurable goals and leaning into them in a somewhat extreme manner.</p>
                <p class="post-content">Both of these criticisms are correct. In most cases, you shouldn’t be writing a new blog post every day, cranking out a book a week, or shipping a new startup each month. Not only are you putting yourself at risk of burning out, but the quality of the thing itself will suffer. So, why do this?</p>
                <p class="post-content">So what’s my point? Take on extreme challenges that might rub people the wrong way. Reign them in when the time is right. Look at your experience and pick out the 20% that matters most, then reap the benefits of doing the thing that doesn’t scale.</p>
